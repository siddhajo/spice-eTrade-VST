# Testing the native wrapper (Mac & Windows)

Bluetooth printing must be tested on a **real Android phone** with the **thermal
paired** — an emulator can't talk to a physical printer. The build steps are the
same on Mac and Windows except where noted.

---

## 0. One-time installs (both platforms)

1. **Node.js LTS (18+)** — <https://nodejs.org> (download the LTS installer).
   - Mac (alternative): `brew install node`
   - Verify: `node -v` and `npm -v`
2. **Android Studio** — <https://developer.android.com/studio>. Install, open it
   once, and let it finish downloading the Android SDK.
   - It **includes the correct JDK (17)** — you do NOT need a separate Java
     install if you build from Android Studio (recommended below).
3. A **USB cable** for the phone.

### Phone prep (do once)
- **Enable Developer mode:** Settings → About phone → tap **Build number** 7
  times. Then Settings → System → Developer options → turn on **USB debugging**.
- **Pair the printer:** Settings → Bluetooth → pair the printer (Classic printers
  must be paired at the OS level before the app can use them).

---

## 1. Configure (both platforms)

Open a terminal in the `mobile-native` folder:
- **Mac:** Terminal.app
- **Windows:** PowerShell **or** Git Bash

```bash
npm install
```

Then edit **`capacitor.config.json`** and set `server.url` to your live host,
e.g. `https://your-app.up.railway.app/mobile`. (Make sure the updated
`public-mobile/app.html` is deployed to that host.)

Create the Android project and sync the plugin:

```bash
npx cap add android
npx cap sync
```

---

## 2. Build + install on the phone — easiest path (Mac & Windows identical)

```bash
npx cap open android
```

This opens the project in **Android Studio**. Then:
1. Plug the phone in via USB (accept the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt on the
   phone).
2. In Android Studio's toolbar, the phone should appear as the target device
   (top center). If not, click the device dropdown and select it.
3. Click the green **Run ▶** button.
4. Android Studio builds, installs, and launches the app on the phone. Accept
   the **Nearby devices / Bluetooth** permission prompt the first time.

> This GUI path uses Android Studio's bundled JDK, so you avoid all
> `JAVA_HOME`/Gradle path issues. Use it for testing.

---

## 3. Build an APK from the command line (optional)

Use this to produce a shareable `.apk` file instead of Run-on-device.

**Mac (or Windows Git Bash):**
```bash
./build-release.sh
# or a quick debug build:
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Windows (PowerShell / Command Prompt):**
`build-release.sh` is a bash script — in PowerShell/CMD run the steps directly:
```powershell
npx cap sync android
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Resulting file:
`mobile-native/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
(release build → `.../apk/release/app-release.apk`).

Copy that APK to the phone (USB, email, or Drive) and tap it to install — allow
**"install from unknown sources"** if prompted.

---

## 4. Verify it works (on the phone)

1. Open the **Spice eTrade** app.
2. Menu (⋮) → **Print method** → cycle to **Bluetooth (app)**.
3. Menu → **Connect Bluetooth printer** → pick your printer.
4. Menu → **🧪 Test print** → a small **"PRINTER OK"** slip should print.
5. Now print a real lot / seller / batch — it goes straight to the printer, **no
   RawBT, no watermark**.

If the test slip prints, you're done. If it prints garbled characters, tell the
developer the printer model — it's a one-line chunk-size/encoding tweak.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Phone not shown in Android Studio | USB debugging on? Try another cable/port; tap "Allow" on the phone. |
| `npx cap` not found | Run `npm install` again inside `mobile-native`. |
| Gradle/Java error on CLI build | Build from Android Studio instead (uses its bundled JDK). |
| "Print method: Bluetooth (app)" option missing | The wrapper's bridge didn't load — rebuild after `npx cap sync`; if a remote `server.url` doesn't surface it, use the **local-bundle fallback** in README.md. |
| "No paired printers" | Pair the printer in Android Bluetooth settings first. |
| App shows a blank/placeholder page | `server.url` is wrong/unreachable, or the phone has no internet. |
